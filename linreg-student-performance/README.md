# Linear Regression - Student Performance Data Set
This directory contains the code and data for a student performance based linear regression algorithm. It aims to predict the next test score grade.

In this learning example, I learned about pre-processing and how to use it to turn categorical values into numerical ones to make predictions. I also learned about saving models.

Ended up with 96.5% accuracy for this example, after running the train 5k times and saving the best one.
