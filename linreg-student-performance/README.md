# Linear Regression - Student Performance Data Set
This directory contains the code and data for a student performance based linear regression algorithm. It aims to predict the next test score grade.

In this learning example, I learned about pre-processing and how to use it to turn categorical values into numerical ones to make predictions.

This example contains both math and portuguese data sets, so I used both.
